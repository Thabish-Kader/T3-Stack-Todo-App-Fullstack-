# T3 Stack Todo App

## Next JS, TRPC, Typescript, Prisma

This full stack todo project was done in order to learn T3 stack development flow. This project was built useing TRPC version 10. Futhermore, completeing this project helped me understand the importance of typesafety and why it is important. The project was bootstrapped useing create-t3-app. An amazing package with a lot of really helpful examples and comments that make it easier to understand how trpc works . All in all huge thanks to the team behind T3 stack. Will surely use it in future projects. I also utilized useQuery hook which is an amazing hook when dealing with forms.
